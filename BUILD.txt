How to build
============

This file describes the steps necessary to build 64 bit version of Npackd 
(GUI, command line or both depending which CMakeLists.txt you use) using MSYS2. 
You can build the 32 bit version replacing the packages mentioned below with 
their 32 bit versions.

- download and unpack QuaZIP from https://github.com/tim-lebedkov/npackd-scripts/releases/download/release_2018.01.01_2/quazip-dev-x86_64-w64_seh_posix_7.2-qt_5.9.2-static-0.7.3.zip
- install and start MSYS2
- execute "pacman -Syuu" twice to update everything
- pacman -S --noconfirm mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-jasper mingw64/mingw-w64-x86_64-qt5-static
- export PATH=/mingw64/bin:$PATH
- mkdir build
- cd build
- export QTDIR=C:/msys64/mingw64/qt5-static (note the use of the forward slashes here!!!)
- cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..\ "-DQUAZIP_ROOT:PATH=C:\Program Files\QuaZIP" "-DQTDIR:PATH=C:\msys64\mingw64\qt5-static" "-DNPACKED_FORCE_STATIC_QT:BOOL=ON" "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel"
- make.exe
